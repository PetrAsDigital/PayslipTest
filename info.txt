I used C# Winforms application because I wanted to use a simple UI where a user could choose the csv input and output file.

Solution description:
interfaces IReader and IPayCalc are injected from an injector

Assumptions:
- the employee is at work the whole month
- the employee doesn't take holidays, days off etc. which would affect the calculations

To run the application pls. run the PayslipApp project and let your intuition do the rest.

Encountered problems:
The test description is not clear in some aspects... 
1)
In one place it says: "Notes: All calculation results should be rounded to the whole dollar. If >= 50 cents round up to the next dollar increment, otherwise round down."
...but in a lot of places it also says "round down" or "round up"

2)
Payment start date and payment end date are not clear enough either, e.g. the input file should be as follows according to the task description:
Input(first name, last name, annual salary, super rate (%), payment start date):
David, Rudd, 60050, 9%, 01 March - 31 March
... this means that 01 March - 31 March is payment start date
