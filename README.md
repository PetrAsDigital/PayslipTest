C# Winforms application for payslips calculation.

I used C# Winforms application because I wanted to use a simple UI where a user could choose the csv input and output file.

Solution description:
interfaces IReader and IPayCalc are injected from an injector

Assumptions:
- the employee is at work the whole month
- the employee doesn't take holidays, days off etc. which would affect the calculations

To run the application pls. run the PayslipApp project and let your intuition do the rest.
